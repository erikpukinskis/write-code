**write-code** is a simple HTML-based code editor. It is not meant to be full featured, it is meant to edit very simple programs that contain only:

* strings
* function literals
* and function calls

### Demo

![GIF of person typing "function rad" which turns magically into "function rad(){" with the closing brace "}" on the next line. They press ENTER and the cursor drops to the next line. They type dad and it appears quoted as "dad". Then they type a ( and the quotes disappear. We now see "function rad(){" on the first line, "dad(" on the second line and ")}" on the third line. Finally they type "sad" which is automatically quoted. The last line is "sad")}. Without the period.](demo.gif)
