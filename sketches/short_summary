Short Summary
Introduce yourself and your background

I'm Erik, I have been building tiny houses. I know how to build simple work spaces with 2xs, plywood, etc.

Briefly describe your campaign and why it's important to you.

I'd like to start a small business, making tempeh and bread, hire someone who likes doing that stuff, send them off with a tiny house structure and all their tools and a place to sleep. Then build another, repeat.

Express the magnitude of what contributors will help you achieve.

Literally the project can't start without soybeans, a roof, etc.

Explain how much funding you need and where it's going.

Tell people about your unique perks. Get them excited!

At first I said the perk is delight in the fulfillment of god's love and care,

but there are t-shirts for sale now too.

Describe where the funds go if you don't reach your entire goal.

Project doesn't start until the goal is hit.

Risks & Challenges
Love and care can't fail.

Also technically I haven't budgeted any money for the t-shirt raw materials, so be forewarned these are going to be cheap Hanes t-shirts with like a dope letterpress.
